# Changelog

Erl2ex is currently pre-alpha software. Expect significant backwards-incompatible changes for the time being.

## v0.0.7 (not yet released)

*   Support invoking a constant macro as a function name.

## v0.0.6 (2016-01-19)

*   Unicode characters greater than 127 were incorrectly encoded in output files, and codepoints greater than 255 caused codegen to crash. Fixed.
*   Convert string() and nonempty_string() Erlang types to the preferred Elixir equivalents, to avoid an Elixir warning.
*   Support for environment variable interpolation in include paths.
*   Support for redefining macros.
*   Support for macro definitions that include comma and semicolon delimited expressions.
*   Generate macros for record_info calls and record index expressions.
*   Erlang characters (e.g. $A) are translated into the Elixir equivalent syntax (e.g. ?A) rather than integers.

## v0.0.5 (2016-01-11)

*   All Erlang macros now translate to Elixir macros, since it seems to be possible for parameterless macros not to be simple values.
*   Variable names could clash with a BIF referenced in another function. Fixed.

## v0.0.4 (2016-01-05)

*   Generate file comments by default.
*   When a comment begins with multiple percent signs, convert all of them to hashes.
*   Separate clauses within a case, receive, or catch leaked variable scopes to each other. Fixed.
*   Support remote function calls with an expression as the function name.
*   Evaluate record_info calls directly since creating a function doesn't seem to work.
*   Ensure "defined_*" attributes are initialized if the erlang source doesn't define them explicitly.
*   Allow definition of constant macros from environment variables or application configs.

## v0.0.3 (2016-01-03)

*   Requires Elixir 1.2. Updated the source for 1.2 warnings and deprecations.
*   Updated and cleaned up ExDoc documentation.
*   Support include_lib directive.
*   Generate comments around each inline included file.
*   Repeated matches on the same variable weren't properly annotated with a caret. Fixed.
*   Funs with no parameters incorrectly translated to a single nil parameter. Fixed.
*   Variable name mangling did not preserve leading underscores. Fixed.

## v0.0.2 (2015-12-31)

*   Better reporting of parse and conversion errors.
*   Support for custom and remote types.
*   Support for the after-clause of receive.
*   Ifdef/ifndef/undef didn't handle capitalized macro names. Fixed.
*   Catch assumed the kind was an atom and didn't accept an expression. Fixed.
*   Recognize bitstring elements with an explicit value, explicit size, and binary type.

## v0.0.1 (2015-12-28)

*   Initial release to hex.
